# Robot Filtering: A Small React Project to test State Changes, API's, and Website Styling

A small side project I created to get comfortable with using React. The [website](https://ben-sikora.github.io/robot_practice/) fetches a list of users from a simple json user generator, found [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users). After getting the list of users, a card is then generated with their basic information and a randomly generated cartoon. The cartoon generator is found [here](https://robohash.org/1?200x200) and can be modified to add a hash and image size. 

Finally, I added a search bar to practice with changes in state and filtering.

The website is also fully dynamic and mobile-friendly. 

This project was created along an Udemy Course, which can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/#reviews).

## Future Plans
1. Organize Folder Structure 
2. Delete robots.js, as using API to retrieve files 
3. Fix Icon and App 
4. Deploy the app as a standalone website
